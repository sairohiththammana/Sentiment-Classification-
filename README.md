"# Sentiment-Classification-" 
The dataset is taken from Kaggle Competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data )

I have used word embeddings from Glove Data (50 dimensional vector)

Please download the Glove data in your working directory ( https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) to train the model. You can train it on any dimensional data. I have used 50 dimensions for computation purpose
